# Automate K3s Cluster Setup on Multipass using Ansible (MacBook)

This project automates the provisioning of a lightweight K3s Kubernetes cluster using Multipass and Ansible on macOS.
It creates one master node and 3 worker nodes, installs K3s, and joins them into a single cluster â€” fully automated from start to finish.

This setup is perfect for learning, testing, and experimentation.
If you want to:

Try out Kubernetes use cases or practice scenarios,

Run certification practice tests (CKA/CKAD/CKS), or

Quickly spin up a fresh environment for hands-on work â€”

you can simply run the playbook again to delete and recreate your entire cluster from scratch.
